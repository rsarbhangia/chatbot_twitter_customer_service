# Customer Support AI Chatbot - Project Description

## Project Overview
Developed a sophisticated AI-powered customer support chatbot system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to provide contextually relevant responses to customer queries. The system is built with scalability, maintainability, and performance in mind, utilizing modern web technologies and best practices in software development.

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture & Design
- Designed and implemented a microservices-based architecture using FastAPI, enabling high-performance API endpoints with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Engineered a robust RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system with configurable search algorithms and reranking capabilities
- Implemented a session-based chat system with automatic cleanup of inactive sessions using APScheduler
- Created a comprehensive logging system for monitoring and debugging

### Backend Development
- Developed RESTful APIs with FastAPI, implementing async/await patterns for improved performance
- Implemented SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations with PostgreSQL support
- Created a sophisticated response evaluation system using OpenAI's API
- Built a configurable RAG system supporting multiple search methods (KNN) and reranking options
- Implemented secure session management with cookie-based authentication

### DevOps & Deployment
- Containerized the application using Docker, creating a production-ready deployment solution
- Implemented environment-based configuration using dotenv
- Set up CORS middleware for secure cross-origin requests
- Created a health monitoring system with dedicated endpoints
- Configured automatic session cleanup for resource optimization

### Database & Storage
- Designed and implemented a relational database schema for storing customer interactions
- Created efficient data models for storing queries, responses, and evaluation metrics
- Implemented local storage system with configurable storage types
- Set up caching mechanisms for improved performance

### Security & Performance
- Implemented secure session management with automatic expiration
- Configured CORS for specific origins to prevent unauthorized access
- Added confidence scoring for response quality assessment
- Implemented rate limiting and request validation
- Set up comprehensive error handling and logging
